# Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom)

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, is a situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callbacks create a visually overwhelming and hard-to-read code structure. It often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations such as nested callbacks, promises, or event handling.

## What is Callback Hell?

Callback Hell occurs when callbacks are nested within callbacks, creating a pyramid-like structure. This pattern can make code difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.

## The Issues
-Readability: The code becomes hard to read and understand due to indentation levels.
-Maintainability: Adding, removing, or modifying functionality within the nested callbacks can be error-prone.
-Error Handling: Managing errors becomes challenging, and it's easy to miss them within the deeply nested structure
